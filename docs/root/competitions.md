### National Python Programmming Competition

##### Description
The national python programming competition was a competitive programming competition hosted by DLSU-D.
Initially, I only joined the junior category, which was intended for freshmen and sophomores (at that time, I was a freshman). However, neither the junior nor senior category have enough participants so they merged the two categories, pitting me against 3rd and 4th year students. I had thought this was going to be a fun experiment of testing my skills; now, it had become a challenging endeavour. So, armed with 4 days of practice by (mostly) reading a book on competitive programming and zero hours of leetcode, it was full steam ahead for the day of the competition.

However, the night before, I had doubts. When the number of participants were revealed and the list of participating universities became a board of intimidation: UP-LB, DLSU, ADMU, Adamson—I wanted to quit. Thankfully, my best friend told me that I should just take this as a learning experience. Personally I knew I was not going to bag a place, given the reputation of the schools that participated. Yet, in my stubborn and competitive mindset, I shrugged away my doubts and took it as a challenge.

Color me surprise when I got 4th place.

I skipped a lab class for this.
