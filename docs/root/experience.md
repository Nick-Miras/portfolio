# Experience
Both of my 'work' experience are related to IoT/Embedded Systems. I already had some knowledge on how to work with such devices before going into college, so naturally I wanted to improve my high-level skills with deeper projects. 

## Research Consultant <Badge type="info" text="Embedded Systems" />
**Company**: `Freelance` | `March 2024 - Present`

Since March 2024, I have been working as a Research Consultant for various high school research groups, focusing on embedded systems and IoT solutions. My role involves designing and developing prototypes of their research projects. I also provide technical advice regarding hardware selection and power delivery. Important highlights of my work include:

- Designed electronic layouts and selected appropriate hardware modules tailored to each project’s functional and budgetary requirements (reduced costs by 50-70%).
- Programmed microcontrollers (Arduino, NodeMCU, Wemos D1, A9G) to control actuators and process sensor data.
- 1st Runner-Up Award: One client project placed in the Top 2 at a regional senior high school research competition.


## Research Intern <Badge type="info" text="Embedded Systems" />
**Company**: `CenGES (University of San Carlos)` | `August 2025 - Present`

CenGES (Center for Geoinformatics and Environmental Solutions) is a research center under the University of San Carlos that focuses on geospatial technologies and environmental monitoring. As a Research Intern, I am involved in projects that utilize Embedded Systems and IoT devices for environmental data collection. Not only that, I was able to contribute to field testing as well. Overall, my responsibilities and contributions include:

- POSTe Project—an embedded systems project for automated and remote flood monitoring
- Contributed in LoRa Integration, Sensor Data Integration, Automated Data Logging
